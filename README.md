# Dockerfile for Cantaloupe image server

[Cantaloupe](https://cantaloupe-project.github.io/) is a
[IIIF-compatible](https://iiif.io/) image server. There is a near-future need to
run an image server for proxying existing image resources through IIIF in order
to unify how we serve images in Finna.

For now, this Dockerfile is only for development work in local docker-compose
environments, and the configurability is not intended for production yet.
